### Usage:

1. Everyone can come and use our app without having to sign up for an account. However, in order to use all the features, we recommend user to log in or sign up.
2. On the home page, we can see all the projects from users.
3. We can filter and sort the projects by their tools, languages, and author name, ect.
4. We can view, like, save, and comment on a specific project.
5. We can also view other users' page as well to see if they have more cool projects to showcase.
6. If we want to contact other users, we can send a direct message to them in realtime.
6. We can go to the upload page and create a project easily as we have instructions for each input field.
7. Finally, we can go to our profile page to see our profile info, edit our background image, view projects that we created, view projects that we liked or saved.

### Key Learning:

- React is a very powerful and dynamic tool, but we have to do it "The React Way".
- In React, state and props management is important.
- Component management is the key.

---

### Challenges:

- Creating a fully functional app in a small amount of time takes a lot of effort.
- The newest version of React and React Router required to use functional component for many features, and it makes class based component difficult to work with
